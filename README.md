# Light Lang (CPP Compiler)

Light lang is a Hobby programming language. It is called Light Lang because it is simple, lightweight.ðŸ”¥

This compiler is written in C++ but hopefully it will get to a point where it can be self-hosted.

## Building

Requires `nasm` and `ld` on a Linux operating system.

```bash
git https://github.com/ashrayk22/Custom_Compiler_in_Cpp_by_NASM.git
